# Logical programming exploration

## Description
This Prolog script, `cat.pl`, is developed as an educational tool to explore logical programming using Prolog. It includes various functions and type definitions that demonstrate how Prolog can handle polymorphic types and operations, making it a valuable resource for learning and understanding these concepts in depth.

## Installation
Ensure you have a Prolog interpreter installed on your system, such as GNU Prolog or SWI Prolog.

```bash
sudo apt-get install swi-prolog
